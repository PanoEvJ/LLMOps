It has practical value as it can be used for warmth, as a makeshift bed, a sail for a mini raft, a weapon in hand-to-hand combat, a shield against noxious fumes or certain creatures, a distress signal, and for drying oneself. It also has immense psychological value. If a non-hitchhiker, or \"strag\", sees a hitchhiker with a towel, they will assume the hitchhiker has other essential items and will be willing to lend any items the hitchhiker might have \"lost\". The strag will also regard the hitchhiker as a person to be reckoned with. This has led to the phrase in hitchhiking slang, \"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is\", indicating respect for someone who is prepared and aware."}]}
