Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external\\nknowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing\\nretrieval-augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only\\nretrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in\\nmore general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually\\ngathering information throughout the generation process is essential. There\\nhave been some past efforts to retrieve information multiple times while\\ngenerating outputs, which mostly retrieve documents at fixed intervals using\\nthe previous context as queries. In this work, we provide a generalized view of\\nactive retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and\\nwhat to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose\\nForward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic\\nretrieval-augmented generation method which iteratively uses a prediction of\\nthe upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a\\nquery to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains\\nlow-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over\\n4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves\\nsuperior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the\\neffectiveness of our method.

However, the processing time required for retrieval\\naugmented large language models poses a challenge when applying them to tasks\\nthat require real-time responses, such as composition assistance.\\n  To overcome this limitation, we propose the Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented\\nGeneration (HybridRAG) framework that leverages a hybrid setting that combines\\nboth client and cloud models. HybridRAG incorporates retrieval-augmented memory\\ngenerated asynchronously by a Large Language Model (LLM) in the cloud. By\\nintegrating this retrieval augmented memory, the client model acquires the\\ncapability to generate highly effective responses, benefiting from the LLM's\\ncapabilities. Furthermore, through asynchronous memory integration, the client\\nmodel is capable of delivering real-time responses to user requests without the\\nneed to wait for memory synchronization from the cloud.
